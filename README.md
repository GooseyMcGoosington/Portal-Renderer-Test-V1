This is the source for my Portal Renderer system, titled Scotch Engine.

This Features;

Entities,
Sector Lighting,
Skies (NOT Skyboxes, it's more of a Skyrectangle),
Portals!!,
Jumping,
Textue Mapping
and soon more...

HOW TO RUN;
To run this, extract the Scotch Engine zip (it should be the latest version).
Run the exe, if it comes up as a virus, then it should most likely be a false positive depending on where you downloaded it from; afaik, this occurs due to the compiler I use.
Freezing is to be expected and should be like a stutter when you are playing.
